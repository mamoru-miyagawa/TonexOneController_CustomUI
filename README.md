# Fork notes

This is a customized fork of **[Builty/TonexOneController](https://github.com/Builty/TonexOneController)**. All credit for the original project goes to the upstream author — see the original README below for project background, supported hardware, build instructions, configuration, and license terms.

The UI redesign was done by me using Affinity Designer and EEZ Studio. The code wiring, custom behavior, and general fixes and tweaks were AI-assisted.

## Hardware support

This fork only targets the **Waveshare 3.5B with a Tonex One** — the only hardware I own, and therefore the only configuration I could develop and test on. If I ever get access to other supported boards I may adapt it; until then, other variants are inherited from upstream but have not been retested here.

I also do not own a Valeton GP-5. Its behavior is unchanged from upstream and no UI updates were made for it. It **should** still work, but is not supported and will probably look broken on the redesigned screens.

## What's different in this fork

### Why a Custom UI? ###
I have made this Customized UI focused on the "signal chain" and preset control. The usability and behavior should be the same as the original build.

**UI changes (480×320 / Waveshare 3.5B only):**
- Many slider widgets replaced with circular arc widgets for a more compact layout, including:
  - BPM (Global)
  - Global tab: Input Trim, Tuning Reference, Master Volume
  - Reverb tab: Mix, Time, Pre-delay, Color
  - Delay tab: TS, Feedback, Mix
  - EQ tab: Bass, Mid, Mid-Q, Treble
  - Amplifier tab: Gain, Volume, Presence, Depth
  - Compressor tab: Threshold, Attack, Gain
  - Noise Gate tab: Threshold, Release, Depth
- The Modulation tab was deliberately left with sliders — its parameters change meaning depending on the selected effect, which doesn't translate well to a fixed-range arc widget.
- Preset label rework: the preset number now shows on its own large label, separate from the preset title.
- Removed amplifier-skin / image assets to free up flash space as they are not used.

**Build tooling:**
- Since I have removed some elements from the original design without changing the core code of how it works, I have to add the missing widget declarations using a script.
- [`tools/restore_compat_stubs.ps1`](tools/restore_compat_stubs.ps1) — re-inserts a hand-maintained "COMPAT STUBS" block of widget declarations into the EEZ-regenerated `screens.h`. EEZ Studio rewrites that file on every regen and wipes the declarations that runtime code (`display.c`, `display_tonex.c`) depends on. Run this script after every EEZ regen, before `idf.py build`.

**Other small fixes:**
- Preprocessor guards in [`footswitches.c`](source/main/footswitches.c) around negative `FOOTSWITCH_*` constants — avoids "shift count is negative" warnings under the stricter ESP-IDF 5.5 toolchain on platforms with fewer than 4 physical switches.
- Watchdog subscription in the display task to force a core-dump on UI freezes (helpful when debugging, but might be removed in the future).

## How to build (this fork)

Identical to upstream — see `FirmwareDevelopment.md` and `HardwarePlatform_Waveshare3.5B.md`. Typical workflow after pulling fresh:

```powershell
cd source
.\tools\restore_compat_stubs.ps1     # only needed if you regenerate the UI from EEZ Studio
idf.py -B build_ws35b build
idf.py -B build_ws35b -p COM<N> flash
```

# Tonex Controller: An open-source controller and display interface for the IK Multimedia Tonex One, Tonex Pedal, and Valeton GP5
This project uses a low-cost embedded controller (Espressif ESP32-S3) to form a bridge to the IK Multimedia Tonex One (which does not have native Midi capability) or the bigger Tonex pedal (new in V2.0.0.2.)
New in V2.0.2.2. is support for the Valeton GP5.
<br>It allows selection of the 20 different presets in the pedal, by any or all of touch screen, WiFi, wired footswitches, bluetooth footswitches, bluetooth servers, and midi programs.
<br>A variety of hardware is supported, from a $6 board with no display, up to a $44 board with a 4.3" touch screen LCD and a pretty graphical user interface.

## Multiple Hardware Devices <a name="multiple_devices"></a>
This project can run on a variery of different hardware platforms, varying in size and cost. All of them are "off-the-shelf" development boards supplied either by the company "Waveshare", or Espressif.
The code could be adapted to run on other brand ESP32-S3 boards, but to make things easy, pre-built releases are provided for the supported modules.
<br>All platforms support Bluetooth, WiFi, wired footswitches, and wired Midi.
- 4.3" LCD board, supporting touch screen and advanced graphics including customisable amp/pedal skins and text
- 1.69" LCD boards (with or without Touch.) Similar to an Apple Watch, this small board displays the preset name and number
- "Zero" board with no display, is the smallest and cheapest option
- "DevKit-C" board with no display
- "Atom S3R" board with tiny LCD
- 1.9" board (with or without Touch.) Displays the preset name and number
- 3.5" LCD boards, supporting touch screen and advanced graphics including customisable amp/pedal skins and text

- User contribution from Jamkid: added ability to click on a parameter value in the web UI, to bring up a dialog box that allows direct entry of a value
- Fixed bug where the 4.3B onboard footswitch disabled mode didn't disable footswitches
- User contribution from Mateusz: when parameters with Sync (syncronise time to the BPM) have the sync enabled, web and 4.3B parameter values change from slider to a drop down with e.g. 1/8, 1/4 etc

- Fixed bug where external footswitch FX toggling, for values that are not boolean, didn't take into account the current value of the parameter when toggling
- Increased maximum external FX switches from 5 to 8
- Added letters to 4.3B effect icons, to show which model is enabled (Modulation, Delay, Reverb)
- Added more footswitch preset layouts to external switches. 1x2, 1x4 binary, disabled etc 
- Added support for switching effects from the onboard footswitches 
- Standardised preset switching layouts for external and internal (onboard) foot switches
- NOTE: due to the preset switching changes, it may be necessary to set your desired configuration again

V1.0.7.2:
- New WiFi options, now allowing connection to other access points.
- Added WiFi status icon for platforms with displays
